  A fully configurable 1:10 on-road and light off-road RC car platform concept
</p>

Love 3D printing? Want a four wheel drive RC rally car? Or a short front wheel drive hot hatch? How about a torque vectoring dragster? What if you want all three, and for them to share as many parts as possible, with changing configuration being as simple as bolting a few parts on and off? This is the Project Gigha (gee-ah) concept, inspired by full size car manufacturers creating 'platforms' for similar cars, which can be modified and tweaked to suit the use case.

# Project goals

Create a suite of compatible sub-assemblies that can be combined and configured to create thousands of different and interesting RC car variants

Be accessible and cost effective for those starting to get involved in the hobby, but flexibile to allow experienced hobbyists to experiment and contribute with new arrangements.

Be well documented and use parts available off the shelf.

Pull together the best of the 3D printed RC community.

Be open source.

Offer a basic / start configuration to get projects moving as quickly as possible.

# Suggested initial sub-assemblies

## Chassis
* Short wheelebase (190mm - 230mm)
* Medium wheelbase (220mm - 260mm)
* Long wheelbase (250mm - 290mm)
* 3D printed
* Aluminium
* CNC carbon

## Front subframe
* Undriven, double wishbone with steering
* 540 size motor, double wishbone with steering
* Belt driven from central motor, double wishbone with steering

## Rear subframe
* Solid axle with panhard rod, undriven
* Double wishbone, undriven
* Double wishbone, 540 size motor
* Twin motor (low-kV outrunner?), multilink?

## Ancilliaries
* Central motor mount
* Battery mounts for predetermined batteries
* RC and FPV equipment mounts and boxes
* Body shell mount

# Get involved
This is a brand new project, aiming to get the best of the 3D printed RC community working together. To share your ideas, please join the Discord server to dicuss, design and build!
