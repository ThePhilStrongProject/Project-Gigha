  A fully configurable 1:10 on-road and light off-road RC car platform
</p>

# Project goals

Create a suite of compatible sub-assemblies that can be combined and configured to create thousands of different and interesting RC car variants.

Be accessible and cost effective for those starting to get involved in the hobby, but flexibile to allow experienced hobbyists to experiment and contribute with new arrangements.

Be well documented and use parts available off the shelf.

Be open source.

Offer a basic / start configuration to get projects moving as quickly as possible.
